# CryptWing

## About
CryptWing is an encryption/decryption software created using python3 and the tkinter GUI package. This application can be used to encrypt custom keys and texts using various cyphers including transposition, Viginere, and Playfair ciphers. The application can also decrypt texts that have been encrypted using these ciphers, given the correct keys are known. 

## Installation
CryptWing has only been tested on macOS, but as far as dependencies go, should run fine on Windows and Linux (GUI based) devices as well. 

On macOS, first install the required dependency: 

`$ brew install python-tk`

then simply clone this repository

`$ git clone https://github.com/shifubear/CryptWing` 

After that, simple `cd` into the CryptWing directory and run main.py. 

## What I learned
#### More about Python3 
This project provided me with a lot of practice using python3, especially creating classes and using them to interact with each other. 
#### Tkinter
As my first fully GUI based project, I struggled to make the widgets go where I wanted them to, and behave the way I planned.
#### Encryption/Decryption
As a student interested in security and cryptographic algorithms, studying and implementing various algorithms proved to be a challenge and great learning experience. Reading about the different weaknesses each have on how to decrypt them was especially fascinating.
