# CryptWing
CS106 Final Project

## About
CryptWing is a encryption/decryption software created using python3 and the tkinter GUI package. 

## Installation
To use CryptWing, simple download all files and put them in a directory called CryptWing, and run main.py. Future updates are planned to create an executable.  

## What I learned
#### More about Python3 
This project provided me with a lot of practice using python3, especially creating classes and using them to interact with each other. 
#### Tkinter
As my first fully GUI based project, I struggled to make the widgets go where I wanted them to, and behave the way I planned.
#### Encryption/Decryption
As a student interested in working in security, studying and implementing various algorithms proved to be a challenge and great learning experience. Reading about the different weaknesses each have on how to decrypt them was especially fascinating.
